DOUBLY-LINKED LISTS IN C PROGRAMMING:
> A doubly linked list is a type of data structure used in computer science and programming. It is a linked list in which each node contains a data element and two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node. This bidirectional linkage allows for easy traversal in both directions, making it useful for various applications.
>Doubly linked lists are a versatile data structure that can be used for various applications. Here are some common use cases and operations for doubly linked lists:

1.Data Storage: Doubly linked lists can be used to store a collection of data elements, such as integers, strings, or custom structures.

2.Insertion and Deletion: Doubly linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning, end, or at specific positions in the list. This is because you can easily traverse the list in both forward and backward directions.

3.Traversal: You can traverse a doubly linked list in both forward and backward directions. This is useful for searching, printing, or performing operations on the list elements.

4.Implementing Stacks and Queues: Doubly linked lists can be used to implement data structures like stacks and queues efficiently. For a stack, you can push and pop elements at one end, and for a queue, you can enqueue elements at one end and dequeue elements from the other end.

5.Undo/Redo Functionality: Doubly linked lists can be used to implement undo and redo functionality in applications. Each node represents a state, and you can move backward and forward through states.

6.Memory Management: Doubly linked lists can be used for memory management in dynamic memory allocation. You can keep track of allocated memory blocks and easily release them when no longer needed.
