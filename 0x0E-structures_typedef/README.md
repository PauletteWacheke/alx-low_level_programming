In computer science, a structure is a user-defined data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type1. Structures are used to create efficient, clear, and organized programs2. They are central to a logical model known as an abstract data type (ADT) and are also central to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)2.

Here’s a brief explanation of what structures are, when, why, and how to use them:

What are Structures?

In programming, a structure is a collection of variables of different data types under a single name1. It can be used to group data that belongs together, which makes the program more organized and easier to understand2.
When to Use Structures?

Structures are used when you need to group different types of data together1. For example, if you want to store information about a student, you might need to group together the student’s name (a string), age (an integer), and GPA (a float). A structure allows you to do this.
Why Use Structures?

Structures help to organize code and make it more readable2. They also make it easier to pass multiple data items as function arguments, and they can be used to return multiple values from a function2.
How to Use Structures?

In C programming, you can define a structure using the struct keyword1. Here’s an example:
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float gpa;
};

This code defines a structure named Student. Each Student has a name, an age, and a gpa. You can create a Student variable and access its members like this:
struct Student s;
strcpy(s.name, "John Doe");
s.age = 20;
s.gpa = 3.5;

This code creates a Student named s, sets its name to "John Doe", its age to 20, and its gpa to 3.5.

The typedef keyword in C is used to assign alternative names to existing types, making the program more portable and easier to understand12. Here’s how you can use typedef:

Defining a New Name for Existing Type:

typedef long long ll;
ll var = 20;
printf("%ld", var);

In this example, ll is now an alias for long long. You can use ll as if it were long long1.

With Structures:

typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    char branch[50];
    int ID_no;
} stu;

stu st;
strcpy(st.name, "John Doe");
strcpy(st.branch, "Computer Science");
st.ID_no = 108;

Here, stu is an alias for the defined structure. This increases code readability as you don’t have to type struct repeatedly1.

With Pointers:

typedef int* ptr;
ptr var;
*var = 20;
printf("Value of var is %d", *var);

In this case, ptr is an alias for int*, which helps in declaring multiple pointers in a single statement1.

With Arrays:

typedef int Arr[4];
Arr temp = {10, 20, 30, 40};

Here, Arr is an alias for an array of 4 integer elements1.

Remember, the use of typedef can make a program more portable and easier to understand2. It’s particularly useful when working with complex data types or when you want to standardize the use of specific data types across multiple source files.
